### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a French guy who knows how to code some stuff but not a lot of stuff if not almost nothing.

- Iâ€™m currently learning : Python, HTML/CSS, bash and C (and english for stop to use deepl when I want to reed        	documentaion)
- I want to learn : JavaScript, Golang, Rust and Ruby

Yes there is only that, yes it is short
